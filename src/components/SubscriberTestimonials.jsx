        text: `As a freelance copywriter who also runs a newsletter, I look forward to Vikra's practical approach. 
        Nothing screams authenticity like Cognition because it is based on so many relatable real-life events. 
        Think of it as a reality TV except it is a newsletter about Vikra's life and it happens to be WAYY more interesting than ours. 
        Don't be jealous. SUBSCRIBE and learn!`

        But whenever I see any edition of Cognition, I know I have to give it a read. 
        It is always so insightful and unfiltered that reading it feels like having a conversation with Vikra. 
        The newsletter is no less than a piece of art, crafted with so much love and passion. 
        I'd highly recommend you subscribe to it to learn everything about freelancing, newsletter growth, movies, books and a lot more!`

        Even though I am a designer by profession, Vikraâ€™s writing style is soooooo good it hooks you till the end, 
        and of course, the way he explains by adding those personal experiences and learnings is absolutely amazing! 
        No clutter, just pure knowledge that too with fun!!!`

        I like how Vikra shares his experiences and learnings without random fluff. 
        Anyone who is starting their freelancing journey or already working as a freelancer should absolutely subscribe to Cognition for some real learnings!`
